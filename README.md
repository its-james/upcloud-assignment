# UpCloud Frontend App

This package contains the UpCloud frontend technology stack and an
unfinished web app.

There are design mockups in the `design-mockups/` directory for the two pages
that this app should show when finished.

### Getting Started

Install the required packages with `yarn install` or `npm i`.

Start the dev server with `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 and you should see the app homepage!

If you are having any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us!

### About the Mockups

The `1-servers-page.png` shows a mockup of the "Servers" page. Users can access
this page via the link at the top-right corner. The page shows a server list
with each server's title, state (green = started, red = stopped, yellow = any
other state), and hostname with the possibility to search and filter the list
based on the server's name and hostname.

At the top-right corner, you can see the "Storages"-link to open the "Storages"
page. The `2-storages-page.png` shows a mockup of the "Storages" page. This is
just a simple list of storages with their title and size.
